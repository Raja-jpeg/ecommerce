Basically, we have 3 sub-repos in our project: Admin, front-end, and back-end respectively.

##### How to run the program?
1. Go directly into the /back_end directory first and run "npm install", and run "npm run start-dev" Then you will see the back-end up and running
2. Navigate to the /front-end directory and run "npm install" and "npm run dev" so that the front end will be running in the meantime.
3. Finally go to the /admin and run the same as step 2 -- "npm install" and "npm run dev"

#### Project goal:
The goal of this project is to develop a fully functional e-commerce platform tailored for online retail. The website will enable users to browse through a catalog of products, add items to a shopping cart, and complete purchases via an integrated checkout system. The platform will be designed with a focus on user-friendly navigation, responsive design for cross-device compatibility, and a secure transaction process. To enhance the shopping experience, features such as product recommendations, user reviews, and order tracking will be incorporated. The backend will be structured to support inventory management, order processing, and data analytics for business insights. This project aims to synthesize full-stack(MERN stack) development skills by building an application that could serve as a cornerstone in a web development portfolio.
